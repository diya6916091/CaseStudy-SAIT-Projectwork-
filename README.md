Smart Farming Sensor Data for Yield Prediction
This project leverages sensor-collected smart farming data to analyze the impact of agricultural practices on crop yield efficiency. It features a Power BI dashboard designed to support data-driven decisions in agriculture by visualizing and interpreting key variables such as fertilizer use, irrigation methods, crop disease status, and temporal yield patterns across 500 global farms.

üìä Project Overview
The primary objective is to uncover insights that help optimize farming practices and promote sustainable agriculture. Key areas of analysis include:

Fertilizer Efficiency: Compare Organic, Inorganic, and Mixed fertilizers to assess their impact on yield.

Irrigation Techniques: Evaluate how different methods (Drip, Sprinkler, Manual, None) affect productivity.

Yield Trends: Track performance from sowing to harvest to reveal seasonal trends.

Crop Disease Monitoring: Understand the prevalence and severity of crop diseases.

Average Yield Efficiency: Calculate yield per hectare per day to gauge overall farm productivity.

‚ùì Key Questions Addressed
What is the average yield efficiency across all farms?

Which irrigation method leads to the highest efficiency?

Which fertilizer type contributes the most to yield?

What are the patterns of disease across different crops?

‚úÖ Key Findings
Average yield efficiency: 33.75 kg/hectare/day.

Top irrigation method: Sprinkler systems showed the highest efficiency.

Best fertilizer type: Inorganic fertilizers slightly outperformed others.

Disease insights: Wheat and Maize showed higher severe/moderate disease levels, requiring targeted interventions.
